# Tutorial 00

This is the staring point to the tutorial series. It is equivalent to where you'd be at if you completed the linux section of setting development environment 
as described by [Vulkan Tutorial](https://vulkan-tutorial.com/Development_environment) with just a few small changes.


## Building

Create a directory for your project and copy the contents of tutorial00 to your directory. Rename .env-example to .env and enter the path to where you
installed the vulkan sdk.

Build the project using make, and run. You should see an empty window appear.
