# Tutorial 01

In the very first tutorial of this series we will be creating a class to encapsulate a glfw window, and a class to run our application. It won't
be until tutorial 4 or 5 that we have enough set up to draw something.


## Building

Create a directory for your project and copy the contents of tutorial01 to your directory. Rename .env-example to .env and enter the path to where you
installed the vulkan sdk.

Build the project using make, and run. You should see an empty window appear.
